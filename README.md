# Arbitrarily-Nakagami-m-Branches


The code is useful to generate the Nakagami-m Variables with Arbitrary Correlation among them. The Procedure was explained in "Zhefeng Song, Keli Zhang and Yong Liang Guan, "Generating correlated Nakagami fading signals with arbitrary correlation and fading parameters," 2002 IEEE International Conference on Communications. Conference Proceedings. ICC 2002 (Cat. No.02CH37333), 2002, pp. 1363-1367 vol.3, doi: 10.1109/ICC.2002.997073."

Kindly cite the Github Profile in anyway use of the code.
